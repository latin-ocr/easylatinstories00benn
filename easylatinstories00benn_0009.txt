PREFACE.

HE aim of this book is to supply easy stories illustrat<
ing the elementary principles of the Simple and
Compound sentence. Short selections from the Public
School Primer (for permission to use which I ani indebted
to the Rev. Canon Kennedy) are printed at the head of the
Notes to eaoh Part: explanation of these is left to the
master. The Geographioal and Historieal N otes are very
brief, as they are intended for boys who are not likely to
be acquainted with Anoient History. I am greatly indebted
to my friend ΜΓ. Arthur Sidgwick for most valuable and
constant help, and for his kindness in revising the whole
work. Ι have also to thank the Rev. F. D. Morioe for
corrections in the text, and Mr. J. S. Phillpotts, Head
Master of Bedford SohooL for some most useful suggestions.
Most of these stories are adapted from an old translation of

Herodotus by Schweighaeuser.
